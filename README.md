                                              Don't Kick Me!

******************************************************************************************************************************

Inspired by Alien Invasion and League of Legends, I developed this Teemo theme, and first shooting mini game. This game was developed using Python modules, Pygame. It is also my first time using Python and Pygame. The title of the game is called "Don't Kick Me" because Teemo was getting kicked in League of Legends' "Pentakill: Mortal Reminder" music video. Although there is no clear evidence on who kicked the cute, little Teemo, I suspect it is Olaf; therefore, Olaf is the bad guy in this game.
